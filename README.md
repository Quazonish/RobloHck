# Is this detected?
Driveless version: yep
<mark>With driver(kernel) version: nope</mark>

# How frequetly it updated?
In my plans <mark>its updating by itself</mark> because it fetches offsets from some api that works.
Also I update it myself when I get new idea to add.
# WTF is this?
This is shitty homemade external/exploit that <mark>you can run everywhere(with driver(kernel) version is impossible to run without admin rights)</mark>
# How to use?
1. Launch Roblox app
2. Teleport into any game
3. Click inject in external
4. Change speed, jump power and FOV, then click apply(if you are using driveless version, it can crash roblox if you change speed or jump power tick too many times)
5. You can set loop fov set if game resets fov(roblox doesnt crash if you set FOV too many times)
6. After death tick applies automatically settings like speed, jump power, and FOV, after you respawn(if you are using driveless version, can crash roblox)
# How this is works?
1. Getting fake datamodel from pointer
2. From fake datamodel it gets real datamodel
3. From datamodel it gets workspace and lighting service
4. From workspace it gets camera
5. From camera it gets humanoid
6. Now it has addresses for speed, jump power, FOV, etc for writing
# Why ESP/aimbot doesnt work properly?
One of the known problem for me is scaled display. For proper ESP/aimbot, <mark>set your display scaling at 100%</mark>
